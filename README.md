# DevEnvFiles
A clean well lighted place for my bash customizations. 

I use [Oh my git](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git) and redirect my .bash_profile to the .bashrc located here. 
local Aliases are kept in their own folder since I don't have this installed in the same space everywhere.
